Drifting like it's 1974<br>Dressing like the Rolling Stones<br>Hey! Ho! Let's go get some more<br>Like young Ramones<br>Some nights feel like very night<br>This one feels brand new<br>Only got bad things on my mind<br>When I'm with you<br><br>And so it goes, we found our sweet disaster<br>In a river of champagne<br>Swimming through the morning after<br>We float away<br><br>Dreaming like it's 1984<br>Dancing like the Talking Heads<br>Last call 40's at the corner store to take to bed<br>Tell me that you need me on the floor<br>Passed out in your dirty clothes<br>Ask me what the hell I'm looking for<br>Like you don't know<br>You're making it so easy<br>To throw myself away<br><br>And so it goes, we found our sweet disaster<br>In a river of champagne<br>Swimming through the morning after<br>We float away<br>Sweet disaster, sweet disaster<br><br>Some nights feel like very night<br>This one feels brand new<br>Only got bad things on my mind<br>When I'm with you<br><br>And so it goes, we found our sweet disaster<br>In a river of champagne<br>Swimming through the morning after<br>We float away<br>Sweet disaster, sweet disaster
