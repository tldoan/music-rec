The club isn’t the best place to find a lover<br>So the bar is where I go<br>Me and my friends at the table doing shots<br>Drinking fast and then we talk slow<br><br>You come over and start up a conversation with just me<br>And trust me I’ll give it a chance now<br>Take my hand stop, put van in the man on the jukebox<br>And then we start to dance<br>And now I’m singing like<br><br>Girl you know I want your love<br>Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>Come on now follow my lead<br>I may be crazy, don't mind me<br><br>Say boy, let’s not talk too much<br>Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>Come on now follow my lead<br>Come, come on now follow my lead<br><br>I'm in love with the shape of you<br>We push and pull like a magnet do<br>Although my heart is falling too<br>I'm in love with your body<br><br>Last night you were in my room<br>And now my bedsheets smell like you<br>Every day discovering something brand new<br>Well I'm in love with your body<br><br>(Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I)<br>I'm in love with your body<br>(Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I)<br>I'm in love with your body<br>(Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I)<br>I'm in love with your body<br>Every day discovering something brand new<br>I'm in love with the shape of you<br><br>One week in we let the story begin<br>We’re going out on our first date<br>You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat<br>Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate<br><br>We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour<br>And how your family is doing okay<br>Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat<br>Tell the driver make the radio play<br>And I'm singing like<br><br>Girl, you know I want your love<br>Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>Come on now follow my lead<br>I may be
