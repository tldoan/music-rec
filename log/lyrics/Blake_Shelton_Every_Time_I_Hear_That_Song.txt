There's something 'bout yesterday<br>How fast it all flies away<br>I don't know what it is about a goodbye kiss<br>That makes you wanna stay<br>We were crazy then we were over<br>We were breaking up, making love, a runaway roller coaster<br><br>Every time I hear that song<br>I'm standing in the pouring rain<br>On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh<br>I still think about you oh-oh-oh<br>Every time I hear that song<br>It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh<br>I still think about you oh-oh-oh<br>I still think about you<br><br>There's something in the bittersweet<br>The feeling of a memory<br>Right there in the moment<br>All I ever wanted was you and me<br>We were crying, we were wasted<br>We were dying when they played it<br><br>Every time I hear that song<br>I'm standing in the pouring rain<br>On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh<br>I still think about you oh-oh-oh<br>Every time I hear that song<br>It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh<br>I still think about you oh-oh-oh<br>I still think about you<br>Oh, I still think about you<br><br>There's a soundtrack in my mind<br>That takes me back in time<br>When I hear that melody<br>I think about you and me<br><br>Every time I hear that song<br>I'm standing in the pouring rain<br>On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh<br>I still think about you oh-oh-oh<br>Every time I hear that song<br>It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh<br>I still think about you oh-oh-oh<br>I still think about you<br>Oh, I still think about you<br>I still think about you<br>Yeah, I still think about you<br><br>There's a soundtrack in my mind<br>That takes me back in time<br>When I hear that melody
