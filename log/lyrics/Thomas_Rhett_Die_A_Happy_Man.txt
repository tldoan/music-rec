Baby, last night was hands down<br>One of the best nights<br>That I've had, no doubt<br>Between the bottle of wine<br>And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye<br>Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain<br><br>And I know that I can't ever tell you enough<br>That all I need in this life is your crazy love<br>If I never get to see the Northern lights<br>Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night<br>Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand<br>Baby, I could die a happy man<br>A happy man, baby<br><br>Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees<br>Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe<br>You're a saint; you're a goddess; the cutest; the hottest; a masterpiece<br>It's too good to be true, nothing better than you<br>In my wildest dreams<br><br>And I know that I can't ever tell you enough<br>That all I need in this life is your crazy love<br>If I never get to see the Northern lights<br>Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night<br>Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand<br>Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah<br><br>I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination<br>Baby, you're my great escape<br>We could stay at home, listen to the radio<br>Or dance around the fireplace<br><br>Well, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia<br>Or drive a sports car up the coast of California<br>Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand<br>Baby, I could die a happy man<br><br>Baby, I could die a happy man<br>Baby, I could die a happy man<br>Oh, I could die a happy man<br>You know I could, girl<br>I could die, I could die a happy man
