I met you in the dark<br>You lit me up<br>You made me feel as though<br>I was enough<br>We danced the night away<br>We drank too much<br>I held your hair back when<br>You were throwing up<br><br>Then you smiled over your shoulder<br>For a minute, I was stone cold sober<br>I pulled you closer to my chest<br>And you asked me to stay over<br>I said, I already told ya<br>I think that you should get some rest<br><br>I knew I loved you then<br>But you'd never know<br>'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go<br>I know I needed you<br>But I never showed<br>But I wanna stay with you<br>Until we're grey and old<br>Just say you won't let go<br>Just say you won't let go<br><br>I wake you up with some breakfast in bed<br>I'll bring you coffee<br>With a kiss on your head<br>And I'll take the kids to school<br>Wave them goodbye<br>And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night<br><br>When you looked over your shoulder<br>For a minute, I forget that I'm older<br>I wanna dance with you right now, oh<br>And you look as beautiful as ever<br>And I swear that everyday you'll get better<br>You make me feel this way somehow<br><br>I'm so in love with you<br>And I hope you know<br>Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold<br>We've come so far my dear<br>Look how we've grown<br>And I wanna stay with you<br>Until we're grey and old<br>Just say you won't let go<br>Just say you won't let go<br><br>I wanna live with you<br>Even when we're ghosts<br>'Cause you were always there for me<br>When I needed you most<br><br>I'm gonna love you till<br>My lungs give out<br>I promise till death we part<br>Like in our vows<br>So I wrote this song for you<br>Now everybody knows<br>That it's just you and me<br>Until we're grey and old<br>Just say you won't let go<br>Just say you won't let go<br><br>Just say you won't let go<br>Oh, just say you won't let go
