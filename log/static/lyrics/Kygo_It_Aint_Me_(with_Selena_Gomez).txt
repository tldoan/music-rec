  <p>[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]<br>
I had a dream<br>
We were sipping whiskey neat<br>
Highest floor, The Bowery<br>
Nowhere's high enough<br>
Somewhere along the lines<br>
We stopped seeing eye to eye<br>
You were staying out all night<br>
And I had enough<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]<br>
No, I don't wanna know<br>
Where you been or where you're goin'<br>
But I know I won't be home<br>
And you'll be on your own<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Selena Gomez]<br>
Who's gonna walk you<br>
Through the dark side of the morning?<br>
Who's gonna rock you<br>
When the sun won't let you sleep?<br>
Who's waking up to drive you home<br>
When you're drunk and all alone?<br>
Who's gonna walk you<br>
Through the dark side of the morning?</a><br>
<br>
[Drop: Selena Gomez &amp; Kygo]<br>
It ain't me<br>
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)<br>
It ain't me<br>
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)<br>
It ain't me<br>
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)<br>
It ain't me<br>
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)<br>
It ain't me<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]<br>
I had a dream<br>
We were back to seventeen<br>
Summer nights and The Libertines<br>
Never growing up<br>
I'll take with me<br>
The polaroids and the memories<br>
But you know I'm gonna leave<br>
Behind the worst of us</a><br>
<br>
[Chorus: Selena Gomez]<br>
Who's gonna walk you<br>
Through the dark side of the morning?<br>
Who's gonna rock you<br>
When the sun won't let you sleep?<br>
Who's waking up to drive you home<br>
When you're drunk and all alone?<br>
Who's gonna walk you<br>
Through the dark side of the morning?</a><br>
<br>
[Drop: Selena Gomez &amp; Kygo]<br>
It ain't me, no no<br>
It ain't me, no no<br>
It ain't me, no no<br>
It ain't me, no no<br>
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?<br>
It ain't me<br>
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)<br>
It ain't me<br>
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)<br>
It ain't me<br>
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)</p>
