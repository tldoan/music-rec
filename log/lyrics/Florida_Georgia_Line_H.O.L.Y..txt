When the sun had left and the winter came<br>And the sky fall could only bring the rain<br>I sat in darkness, all broken hearted<br>I couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone<br>I never meant to cry, started losing hope<br>But somehow baby, you broke through and saved me<br><br>You're an angel, tell me you're never leaving<br>'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in<br><br>You're holy, holy, holy, holy<br>I'm high on loving you, high on loving you<br>You're holy, holy, holy, holy<br>I'm high on loving you, high on loving you<br><br>You made the brightest days from the darkest nights<br>You're the river bank where I was baptized<br>Cleanse all the demons<br>That were killing my freedom<br>Let me lay you down, give me to ya<br>Get you singing babe, hallelujah<br>We'll be touching, we'll be touching heaven<br><br>You're an angel, tell me you're never leaving<br>'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in<br><br>You're holy, holy, holy, holy<br>I'm high on loving you, high on loving you<br>You're holy, holy, holy, holy<br>I'm high on loving you, high on loving you<br><br>I don't need the stars 'cause you shine for me<br>Like fire in my veins, you're my ecstasy, you're my ecstasy<br><br>You're holy, holy, holy, holy<br>I'm high on loving you, high on loving you<br>You're holy, holy, holy, holy<br>I'm high on loving you, high on loving you<br><br>You're the healing hands where it used to hurt<br>You're my saving grace, you're my kind of church<br>You're holy
